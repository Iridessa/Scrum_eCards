 **TODO**
 - clean up txt files use MarkDownSyntax and move them to SCRUMcontent folder
 - move js file to assets folder
 - move lib/shower in assets folder
 - just file style.css from theme into assets 
 - add some div for english in slides/E-Cards/index:html
 - add the arabic language as ar.html file
 - add the german language as de.html file
 - Change the title of the Index.
 - Change the subtitle of the Index.

### Directory Structure ###

  1. README.md - this File
  2. index.html - a File almost without Javascript to just have an Entrance and Overview of all Presentations
  3. assets - Directory with all StyleSheets Javacript and Images File as well as external Source 
  4. slides - Directory Each Presentation has a Folder with all the required Files except the shared Code
     
     Presentations a made in multi Languages for each one html-File. 
     The Syntax should be copied from assets/shower/*.html

  6. if there is more it still has to be moved on right place
